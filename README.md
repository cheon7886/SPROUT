Concept Design of Reprap-Styled 3D Printer
![SPROUT](https://github.com/cheon7886/SPROUT/blob/master/Rendering_Image.jpg)  

Designed for Replicate printer itself    
Exclude some parts(Aluminium Profile, Motor, Circuit), most of parts is 3D-Printable. Some parts can be printed or milled.   

Feature
-
**-Enhanced Sustainability**    
-Both Milling/Printing available for manufacturing parts.    
    
**-Flange type Linear Bearing & Aluminium Z axis Backplane**    
->Used 4 Shaft for Z axis fastner, with collaboration of those parts, Get sustainability and accuracy than other RepRap Printers     because of elmination of vibration and deflection of weight point by equal&tight 4 shafts.    
Furthermore, With simple design, you can build your 3d printer with low cost as other RepRap Printers.    
    
**-Easy&Strong Threaded rod + Nut**  
You can use Threaded rod with nut as others, but this design allow you to easily fix nut also clinch your axis.    
    
**-Z Axis Bearing Guide**   
By using axis guides, you can block issues when building printer, from using two rods.    

**Noise Killing + Precise Printing Ability**
