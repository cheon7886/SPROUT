Reprap-Styled 3D Printer
![SPROUT](https://github.com/cheon7886/SPROUT/blob/master/Rendering_Image.jpg)  
Designed for Replicate printer itself
Exclude some parts(Aluminium Profile, Motor, Circuit), most of parts can be 3D Printed.
In order to everyone can contribute, I put original CAD file(solidworks) and IGES file with STL file.
Feature
-
**Enhanced Sustainability**
-Both Milling/Printing available for manufacturing parts.  
-Flange type Linear Bearing & Aluminium Z axis Backplane  
->Used 4 Shaft for Z axis fastner, with collaboration of those parts, Get sustainability and accuracy than other RepRap Printers because of elmination of vibration and deflection of weight point by equal&tight 4 shafts.  
Furthermore, With simple design, you can build your 3d printer with low cost as other RepRap Printers.  
-Easy&Strong Threaded rod + Nut  
You can use Threaded rod with nut as others, but this design allow you to easily fix nut also clinch your axis.  
-Z Axis Bearing Guide   
By using axis guides, you can block issues when building printer, from using two rods.  
**Noise Killing + Precise Printing Ability**
